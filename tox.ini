# 'Tox' is a tool for automating sdist/build/test cycles against
# multiple Python versions:
#   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox
#   https://tox.readthedocs.io

# To run against a specific subset of Python versions, use:
# tox -e py36,py37
# tox -e lint

# Extra arguments will be passed to test-installed-scipy.py. To run
# the full testsuite:
#   tox full
# To run with extra verbosity:
# tox -- -v
